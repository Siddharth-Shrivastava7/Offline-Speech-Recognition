The three main arguments we give to pocketsphinx_continuous which may determine the accuracy are as follows

  -hmm : The Acoustic Model
  -lm : The Language Model
  -dict : The Dictionary


The Acoustic Model is created by taking audio of speech and the corresponding text transcription. 
Then statistical representations of the sounds that make up each word are created from this data to make the Acoustic Model.
The one which comes with pocketsphinx is the most optimized and comprehensive. 
Hence, we don’t need to create another acoustic model, we’ll just use the one we have.

The Language Model is actually a statistical language model which assigns probability to each word that it’s given using a probability distribution formula.

The Dictionary is the actual set of words which are given to the language model. 
The dictionary also represents how the words are pronounced.

So, since we’ll be using the default acoustic model, we can change the language model and the dictionary to add more, new words.

>>> To do that, create a new file and add the words which you want to be specifically recognized, 
this will be your corpus:

sample.txt (filename)

Vision
speak
look
currency
sleep

>>> Save it

Then, go to the following link: http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool.html Use the newer version of lm tool mentioned there. 

>>> Under "Upload a sentence corpus file:" Select the corpus file you’ve created from your local repository
(here we’ve made ‘sample.txt‘) so upload sample.txt file.

>>> Build the corpus by clicking on the ‘COMPILE KNOWLEDGE BASE’ button.


You’ll see a screen with a headline "Sphinx knowledge base generator [lmtool.3a]"


>>> Save ‘Dictionary’ and ‘Language Model’ files in your computer, where pocketsphinx model en-us is saved.

(e.g. /home/username/pocketsphinx/model/en-us/filename_generated_from_base_generator.lm.bin

      /home/username/pocketsphinx/model/en-us/filename_generated_from_base_generator.dic )


>>> convert the ‘Language Model’ into binary by changing its file extension from ".lm" to ".lm.bin"
